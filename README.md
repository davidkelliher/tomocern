# tomocern

The original CERN tomography code in Fortran with a simple python interface. The original code, by Steve Hancock, can be found here
https://tomograp.web.cern.ch/

Note that a recent rewrite of the code in python/C++ exists here https://github.com/PhaseSpaceTomography/longitudinal-tomography.

To compile this code first run "make clean" then run "make" in the top level directory.

Then run python/tomo.py.
